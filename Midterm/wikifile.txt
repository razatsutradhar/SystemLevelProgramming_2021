GameStop Corp. is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer.[2] The company is headquartered in Grapevine, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), United States, and is the world's largest video game retailer, operating 5,509 retail stores throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe as of February 1, 2020.[1][3] The company was founded in Dallas in 1984 as Babbage's, and took on its current name in 1999. The company's retail stores primarily operate under the GameStop, EB Games, ThinkGeek, and Micromania-Zing brands.[2] The company declined during the mid-late 2010s due to the shift of video game sales to online storefronts and failed investments by GameStop in smartphone retail.

In 2021, the company's stock price skyrocketed due to a short squeeze orchestrated by users of the Internet forum r/wallstreetbets. The company received major media attention during January and February of 2021 due to the volatility of its stock price.

In addition to retail stores, GameStop owns Game Informer, a video game magazine.[2]
Babbage's (1984–1994)
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[4] The company was named after Charles Babbage[5] and opened its first store in Dallas's NorthPark Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[6] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[4] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[7] The company went public in 1988.[5] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[7]

NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[8] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[8] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. President Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[9]

Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatteo, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[10] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[11]

NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[12] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[13] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[14]

The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[14]

Babbage's Etc. (1996–1999)
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[15] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[15] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[16]

Barnes & Noble Booksellers (1999–2004)
Barnes & Noble Booksellers purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[17] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble Booksellers evaluated and signed off on the deal.[17] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[18] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[19] With its acquisition of Funco (also known as FuncoLand),[20] Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[19]

Barnes & Noble Booksellers took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]

GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]

GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video-game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video-game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009.
